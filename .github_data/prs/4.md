## Description

This PR implements the ability to mount projects in subdirectories of
`/workspace` instead of directly at `/workspace`. This enables
multi-project development by allowing multiple repositories to be mounted
simultaneously in a single devcontainer.

The implementation includes:

- Project mounting to `/workspace/<project_name>` subdirectory structure
- Docker Compose override support for mounting additional folders
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Full integration test coverage

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing
  functionality to not work as expected)
- [x] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [x] Test updates

## Changes Made

### Core Mount Structure Changes

- Changed default project mount from `/workspace` to
  `/workspace/<project_name>` subdirectory
- Updated `workspaceFolder` in devcontainer.json to `/workspace/devcontainer`
- Modified `docker-compose.yml` to use relative path (`..`) for project
  mounting
- Updated `postAttachCommand` path to match new subdirectory structure
- Adjust all initialization scripts (`init-git.sh`, `init-precommit.sh`,
  `setup-git-conf.sh`, `post-attach.sh`)

### Environment Variable Cleanup

- Removed redundant `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` and `IN_CONTAINER` from
  docker-compose.yml (inherited from base image)
- Removed `PRE_COMMIT_HOME` from Containerfile (now project-specific, set
  in docker-compose.yml)
- Added `PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable for script consistency

### Docker Compose Override Support

- Added `.devcontainer/.gitignore` to ignore user-specific override files
- Created `docker-compose.override.yml.example` template with common mount
  patterns
- Added comprehensive `MOUNTS.md` documentation (169 lines) covering:
  - Quick start guide
  - Mount patterns (sibling projects, home directory, absolute paths,
    read-only)
  - Troubleshooting and performance considerations
  - Real-world examples (monorepo, frontend+backend, reference docs)
- Updated README.md with mounting section and quick start

### Testing Infrastructure

- Modified `conftest.py` fixture to test override functionality:
  - Creates test override file mounting tests directory
  - Updates devcontainer.json to include override (required for devcontainer
    CLI)
  - Proper cleanup after tests
- Added `TestDockerComposeOverride` test class with 4 integration tests:
  - Directory existence verification
  - File accessibility checks
  - File reading operations
  - Directory listing and multiple file validation

### Test Updates

- Updated 15+ integration tests to expect subdirectory mount structure
- Modified tests to check for relative path (`..`) in volumes
- Updated all path references from `/workspace` to `/workspace/test_project`
- Removed `test_pre_commit_home_set` from image tests (no longer in base
  image)
- Added test for no redundant `containerEnv` in devcontainer.json

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`make test`)
- [x] Image tests pass (`make test-image`)
- [x] Integration tests pass (`make test-integration`)
- [ ] Registry tests pass (`make test-registry`) (if applicable)
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

1. **Subdirectory Mounting**: Verified project mounts to
   `/workspace/<project_name>` correctly
2. **Override Functionality**: Tested mounting additional folders using
   `docker-compose.override.yml`:
   - Mounted sibling project successfully
   - Verified file access and permissions
   - Confirmed directory listing works
3. **Script Execution**: All initialization scripts (`init-git.sh`,
   `init-precommit.sh`, `post-attach.sh`) run without errors
4. **VS Code Integration**: Dev Container opens to correct workspace folder
5. **Multi-project Setup**: Successfully mounted and accessed multiple
   projects simultaneously

## Additional Notes

### Breaking Change Notice

This is a **breaking change** from any previous devcontainer setup (though
no official release exists yet). Projects using the old structure will need
to:

1. Update their `.devcontainer` configuration with the new template
2. Adjust any scripts referencing `/workspace` to use the new subdirectory
   structure

### Key Implementation Details

**Mount Resolution**: The implementation uses `..` (relative path) instead of
`${localWorkspaceFolder}` because:

- The devcontainer CLI doesn't expand `${localWorkspaceFolder}` correctly
  with podman-compose
- Relative paths work consistently across Docker and Podman
- The path is relative to the `.devcontainer` directory

**Override File Handling**: For the devcontainer CLI to use override files,
they must be explicitly listed in `devcontainer.json`:
"dockerComposeFile": [
  "docker-compose.yml",
  "docker-compose.override.yml"
]VS Code's Dev Containers extension handles this automatically, but manual
CLI usage requires explicit configuration.

### Benefits

- Enables multi-project development workflows
- Better workspace organization
- Supports monorepo and microservices architectures
- Per-developer customization without git conflicts
- Standard Docker Compose patterns
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
