## Description

This PR addresses and fixes the issues found during the push mechanism in the previous release attempt.
It refines the push pipeline for multi-arch builds, ensures registry cleanup across architectures, and updates release metadata.

## Type of Change
- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [ ] Test updates

## Changes Made
- Export platform list, tag native builds with explicit arch, and streamline native/multi-arch build, push, and manifest steps in `push.sh`, including a temporary arch-less tag for tests.
- Add an arch-suffix helper and autouse fixture in registry tests to ensure no arch-suffixed images remain after test runs.
- Update README and CHANGELOG metadata for the 0.1 release (date and image size).

## Testing
All tests pass locally (`make test` - runs image, integration, and registry tests)

- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas

## Additional Notes
- `devcontainer up` integration setup now succeeds by retagging the native build to an arch-less tag for tests; the tag is removed afterward.
