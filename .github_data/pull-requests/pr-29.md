# [PR 29](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/29) fix(ci): prevent GHCR push 403 in publish workflow

## Description

Fixes intermittent `403 Forbidden` errors when pushing image layers to GHCR in the publish workflow by ensuring the workflow uses the correct GHCR auth context and explicit job permissions.

## Related Issue(s)

Closes #

## Type of Change

- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [ ] Test updates

## Changes Made

- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` with a fix note for GHCR publish workflow push permissions/auth to avoid `403 Forbidden` on blob/layer checks.

## Testing

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [ ] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

- N/A (workflow/CI change; verify by re-running `Publish Container Image` on a tag or `workflow_dispatch` with `publish=true`)

## Checklist

## Additional Notes

If CI still fails to push to GHCR, it likely indicates an org/package permission policy issue (outside the workflow) rather than the build itself.
