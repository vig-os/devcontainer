# [PR 56](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/56) chore(ci): register release workflows on main

## Summary

- Copies 3 release-related workflows (`prepare-release.yml`, `release.yml`, `post-release.yml`) and 4 required composite actions (`setup-env`, `build-image`, `test-image`, `test-integration`) from `dev` to `main`
- This registers the `workflow_dispatch` triggers in the GitHub Actions tab, which currently cannot discover workflows that only exist on non-default branches
- No existing workflows on `main` are removed or modified

## Context

GitHub only indexes `workflow_dispatch` workflows present on the default branch. Since these release workflows have never existed on `main`, they are invisible to `gh workflow run`, the REST API, and the Actions UI. See #55 for full details.

## Scope

**Release-only** -- other new workflows (`ci.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `scorecard.yml`, `security-scan.yml`) are excluded and will arrive with the full `dev` merge.

## Post-merge verification

- [ ] `prepare-release.yml` and `release.yml` appear in Actions tab
- [ ] `gh workflow run prepare-release.yml --ref dev -f version=0.2.2 -f dry-run=true` succeeds
- [ ] No existing workflows on `main` are broken
