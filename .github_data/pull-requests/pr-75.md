# [PR 75](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/75) feat: allow chore branches without issue references

## Description

Allow chore branches that don't require issue references. This addresses a gap in the branch naming convention where routine maintenance tasks (dependency updates, syncing branches, etc.) had to be awkwardly tied to non-existent issues.

## Type of Change

- [x] Documentation update
- [x] Refactoring (no functional changes)

## Changes Made

- Updated branch naming convention to allow `chore/<short-summary>` branches without issue numbers
- Updated pre-commit hook regex to allow chore branches
- Added chore branch examples and workflow documentation to RELEASE_CYCLE.md
- Updated branch-naming.mdc rule with issue requirement indicators and chore branch guidance

## Testing

- [x] Manual testing performed (verified regex pattern allows chore branches and blocks invalid formats)

## Checklist

- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings or errors

Closes #74
