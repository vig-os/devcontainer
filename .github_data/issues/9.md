## Issue

The `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` currently uses the `dev` tag:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/vig-os/devcontainer:dev
```

## Question

After deployment of the devcontainer to a project, should the image version be frozen/pinned instead of using `dev`?

### Considerations:
- **`:dev`** - Currently used, but this tag is for development builds and may change unexpectedly
- **`:latest`** - Points to the most recent stable release, but still not frozen
- **Pinned version (e.g., `:1.0`)** - Would provide stability and reproducibility

## Context

The `dev` tag is used by `make build` for local development builds. For production use or when deploying to other projects, a frozen version would:
1. Ensure reproducible builds
2. Prevent unexpected breaking changes
3. Allow controlled upgrades

## Discussion Points
- Should this file use a pinned version, `latest`, or keep `dev`?
- If a pinned version is preferred, should the `{{IMAGE_TAG}}` placeholder system be extended to cover the `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` as well?
