# [PR 160](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/160) feat(worktree): add filter mode for worktree-clean (#158)

## Description

Adds a `mode` parameter to `worktree-clean` so the default cleans only stopped worktrees (no running tmux session), while `just worktree-clean all` retains the previous behavior (clean all worktrees). Summary output shows what was cleaned vs skipped.

## Type of Change

<!-- Mark the relevant option(s) with an 'x' -->

- [x] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [x] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- **justfile.worktree**: Add `mode=""` parameter to `worktree-clean`; stopped-only logic skips dirs with running tmux sessions; `all` mode retains previous behavior with warning; summary output (cleaned vs skipped)
- **assets/workspace/.devcontainer/justfile.worktree**: Synced via manifest
- **tests/bats/worktree.bats**: BATS tests for stopped-only, all mode, invalid mode, wt-clean alias
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Entry under Changed

## Changelog Entry

### Changed

- **worktree-clean: add filter mode for stopped-only vs all** ([#158](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/158))
  - Default `just worktree-clean` (no args) now cleans only stopped worktrees, skips running tmux sessions
  - `just worktree-clean all` retains previous behavior (clean all worktrees) with warning
  - Summary output shows cleaned vs skipped worktrees
  - `just wt-clean` alias unchanged

## Testing

<!-- Describe the tests you ran and how to verify your changes -->
- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

- `just worktree-clean` (no args): cleaned only stopped worktrees, skipped running session
- `just worktree-clean all`: cleaned all worktrees including running sessions
- `just wt-clean` and `just wt-clean all`: alias works
- `just worktree-clean invalid`: exits with error
- BATS: `just test-bats` — all 238 tests pass including 4 new worktree-clean tests
