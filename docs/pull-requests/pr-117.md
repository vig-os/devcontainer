# [PR 117](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/117) chore: add granular CODEOWNERS for agent workflow areas (#116)

## Description

Add granular CODEOWNERS rules for agent workflow areas based on git history analysis of contributor activity per file/folder. Replaces the catch-all `*` rule with specific ownership entries so that changes to `.cursor/skills/` and `justfile.worktree` are routed to `@gerchowl`, while CI/CD, build scripts, and security-sensitive files remain under `@c-vigo`.

## Related Issue(s)

Closes #116

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)

- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [x] CI / Build change

## Changes Made

- Removed the `* @c-vigo` catch-all rule
- Added `.cursor/skills/ @gerchowl` ownership rule
- Added `justfile.worktree @gerchowl` ownership rule

## Changelog Entry

No changelog needed — internal repo configuration with no user-visible impact.

## Testing

- [x] Verified CODEOWNERS syntax follows [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
- [x] Confirmed last-match-wins precedence is correct (specific rules after general ones)

## Checklist

- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged and published

## Additional Notes

Ownership scopes were determined by analyzing git history (commits, branches, authors) per area — see #116 for the full contributor-by-area matrix.
