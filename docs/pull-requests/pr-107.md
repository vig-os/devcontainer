# [PR 107](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/107) chore: merge main into dev after sync-issues fix (#91)

## Summary

- Merge `main` into `dev` to bring in the sync-issues schedule trigger fix from PR #100
- Remove stale `.github_data/` directory (67 files on dev that were superseded by `docs/issues/` and `docs/pull-requests/`)
- Update CHANGELOG with the schedule fix and `.github_data` removal entries under `## Unreleased`

Refs: #91

## Test plan

- [x] Verify `.github_data/` directory no longer exists on dev after merge
- [x] Verify `sync-issues.yml` on dev matches the canonical version from main (with `|| 'dev'` fallbacks and parameterized inputs)
- [x] Verify CHANGELOG entries are correctly placed under `### Fixed` and `### Removed`

Refs: #91
