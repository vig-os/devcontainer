# [PR 193](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/193) refactor(skills): add pull-latest-base-before-pr to PR-creating skills (#192)

## Description

Adds a "pull latest base branch and merge" step to all PR-creating skills before creating or pushing a pull request. Ensures branches are up to date with `origin/dev` (or the target base) to avoid merge conflicts and stale code in PRs.

## Type of Change

<!-- Mark the relevant option(s) with an 'x' -->

- [x] `feat` -- New feature
- [x] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- **pr_create**: Step 1 now merges `origin/<base_branch>` after base is confirmed. Conflict handling: ask user to resolve manually.
- **pr_solve**: Step 5 now merges `origin/<base_branch>` (from PR metadata) before first push. Conflict handling: ask user to resolve.
- **worktree_pr**: Reordered steps so base branch is determined first (step 1), then step 2 ensures clean state including merge of `origin/<base_branch>` before push. Conflict handling: invoke worktree_ask to post question on issue.
- **worktree_solve-and-pr**: Inherits merge step via worktree_pr (no direct changes).
- **solve-and-pr**: Delegates to worktree_solve-and-pr (no changes needed).
