# [PR 45](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/45) feat: add --org flag to install script (#33)

## Description

Add `--org` flag to `install.sh` allowing users to override the default organization name when deploying the devcontainer. The default organization is `vigOS`.

## Related Issue(s)

Closes #33

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [x] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [x] Test updates

## Changes Made

- **install.sh** (+15 lines): Added `--org ORG` option to argument parsing, help text, and examples. Pass `ORG_NAME` as environment variable to the container.
- **tests/test_install_script.py** (+41 lines): Added unit tests for `--org` flag:
  - `test_org_flag_in_help` - Verifies flag is documented
  - `test_default_org_in_dry_run` - Verifies default is `vigOS`
  - `test_custom_org_in_dry_run` - Verifies custom org override works
- **docs/templates/README.md.j2** (+3 lines): Added usage example for `--org` flag
- **README.md** (+3 lines): Regenerated from template
- **CHANGELOG.md** (+5 lines): Documented feature under Unreleased > Added

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

```bash
# Verified --org appears in help
./install.sh --help | grep org

# Verified default ORG_NAME=vigOS in dry-run
./install.sh --dry-run /tmp/test

# Verified custom org override
./install.sh --dry-run --org MyOrg /tmp/test
```
