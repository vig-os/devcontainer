# [PR 119](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/119) chore: align PR template with commit types and release cycle

## Description

Align the PR template's "Type of Change" section with the project's canonical commit types and add release-cycle awareness.

## Type of Change

- [x] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)

### Modifiers

## Changes Made

- **Type of Change section**: replaced 7 ad-hoc checkboxes with the 10 canonical commit types (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`, `style`)
- **Breaking change modifier**: moved from being a type to a separate "Modifiers" subsection with the `!` convention
- **Related Issues section**: added a comment hinting about bugfix PRs targeting release branches
- **Refs section**: added a `Refs:` prompt at the bottom of the template

## Changelog Entry

### Changed
- **PR template aligned with canonical commit types** ([#115](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/115))
  - Replace ad-hoc Type of Change checkboxes with the 10 canonical commit types
  - Move breaking change from type to a separate modifier checkbox
  - Add release-branch hint to Related Issues section
