# [PR 65](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/65) feat: add Cursor commands and rules for agent-driven development workflows (#63)

# Pull Request

## Description

Add Cursor commands and rules for agent-driven development workflows, covering the full lifecycle from brainstorming through implementation, testing, review, CI debugging, and verification.

This addresses the gap where coding agents had no structured guidance for most development activities beyond committing and PR submission.

## Related Issue(s)

Closes #63

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [ ] CI / Build change
- [ ] Test updates

## Changes Made

### New always-on rules (2)
- **`coding-principles.mdc`** — 6 principles enforced on every edit: YAGNI, minimal diff, DRY, no secrets, traceability, single responsibility
- **`tdd.mdc`** — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR discipline for testable changes

### New commands — Tier 1 (6)
- **`start-issue.md`** — Start work on an issue: read issue, stash if needed, `gh issue develop`, checkout
- **`create-issue.md`** — Create a GitHub issue: detect template type, populate fields, correct labels
- **`brainstorm.md`** — Design before code: explore context, ask questions one at a time, propose approaches, get approval
- **`tdd.md`** — Full TDD workflow using `just test-*` recipes
- **`review.md`** — Self-review: diff against acceptance criteria, check changelog, commit messages, structured severity report
- **`verify.md`** — Verification before completion: run tests, evidence only, no "should work" claims

### New commands — Tier 2 (2)
- **`check-ci.md`** — Check CI status: `gh pr checks`, show pass/fail per workflow
- **`fix-ci.md`** — Diagnose failing CI: fetch logs, trace root cause, no guessing

### New commands — Tier 3 (3)
- **`plan.md`** — Break design/issue into bite-sized tasks with file paths and verification steps
- **`execute-plan.md`** — Execute plan in batches with human checkpoints
- **`debug.md`** — Systematic debugging: 4-phase root cause process, no fixes without investigation

### Updated
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — Entry under `## Unreleased / ### Added`

## Changelog Entry

### Added

- **Cursor commands and rules for agent-driven development workflows** ([#63](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/63))
  - Always-on rules: `coding-principles.mdc` (YAGNI, minimal diff, DRY, no secrets, traceability, single responsibility) and `tdd.mdc` (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR discipline)
  - Tier 1 commands: `start-issue.md`, `create-issue.md`, `brainstorm.md`, `tdd.md`, `review.md`, `verify.md`
  - Tier 2 commands: `check-ci.md`, `fix-ci.md`
  - Tier 3 commands: `plan.md`, `execute-plan.md`, `debug.md`

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`) — no test changes; this is commands/rules only
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

- All pre-commit hooks passed on both commits (yamllint, pymarkdown, branch-name, commit message validation, typos)
- Verified all markdown files are well-formed
- Verified changelog entry follows existing format

## Checklist

- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly (edit `docs/templates/`, then run `just docs`)
- [x] I have updated `CHANGELOG.md` in the `[Unreleased]` section (and pasted the entry above)
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged and published

## Additional Notes

- No executable code is added — all files are Cursor commands (`.md`) and rules (`.mdc`), which are agent instructions only.
- Worktree/parallel agent support was explored during this work and scoped as a separate issue: #64
- Inspired by [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) agentic skills framework.
