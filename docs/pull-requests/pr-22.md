# [PR 22](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/22) Release Candidate 0.2.0

## Description

This PR introduces **Release 0.2.0** of the vigOS Development Environment, featuring major improvements in build automation, Python development workflow, container runtime support, and developer experience.

Key highlights:

- **Build automation migration**: Replaced `make` with `just` for modern, maintainable build recipes
- **Python project template**: Pre-configured Python project structure with pre-built virtual environment
- **Podman support**: Full Podman compatibility with socket detection and comprehensive testing
- **Docker Compose reorganization**: Improved override system with `project.yaml` and `local.yaml` separation
- **Documentation generation**: Docs-as-code system with Jinja2 templates
- **License compliance**: Pre-commit hook for dependency license checking
- **Enhanced testing**: Improved test infrastructure with container cleanup and better error handling
- **One-line install script**: Curl-based quick deployment for new projects

## Related Issue(s)

- Closes #1 - Implement "just" (build automation + version-check self-update)
- Closes #8 - Implement sidecars
- Closes #13 - VS Code settings using uv virtual environment Python interpreter
- Closes #14 - Install python tools via pyproject.toml and not specifics in containerfile
- Fixes #15 - docker-compose.override.yml is not picked up
- Closes #16 - Use pre-commit cache directly from container
- Fixes #19 - Various bug fixes
- Closes #21 - Add curl-based install script for quick devcontainer deployment

## Latest Additions (Jan 6, 2026)

### One-Line Install Script (`install.sh`)

New curl-based deployment for quick project setup:

```bash
curl -sSf https://vig-os.github.io/devcontainer/install.sh | sh -s -- ~/Projects/my-project
```

Features:
- Auto-detect podman/docker runtime (prefers podman)
- Auto-derive project name from folder (sanitized: lowercase, underscores)
- OS-specific installation instructions (macOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Windows)
- Runtime health check with troubleshooting advice
- Flags: `--force`, `--version`, `--name`, `--dry-run`, `--docker`, `--podman`

### Non-Interactive Mode for `init-workspace.sh`

- Added `--no-prompts` flag for CI/automation use
- `SHORT_NAME` environment variable support
- `ORG_NAME` now defaults to "vigOS/devc"

### New Test Suite

- 19 tests for `install.sh` (8 unit + 11 integration)
- Tests name sanitization, placeholder replacement, default ORG_NAME

## Type of Change

- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [x] Documentation update
- [x] Test updates

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [x] Image tests pass (`just test-image`)
- [x] Integration tests pass (`just test-integration`)
- [x] Registry tests pass (`just test-registry`)
- [x] Install script tests pass (19 tests)
- [x] Manual testing performed

**Total: 84+ tests passing**

## Checklist

- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly
- [x] I have updated the CHANGELOG.md in the `[Unreleased]` section
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes

## Breaking Changes

1. **Build Automation**: All `make` commands replaced with `just`
2. **Docker Compose Overrides**: `docker-compose.override.yml` → `project.yaml` + `local.yaml`
3. **ORG_NAME**: Now defaults to "vigOS/devc" instead of requiring user input

## Release Proposal: v0.2.0

After approval:
```bash
just push version=0.2.0
```

@gerchowl I modified `init.sh` to run on my Ubuntu, check that it still runs on macOS

How is this supposed to work?

```bash
carlosvigo@vigolaptop:~$ curl -sSf https://vig-os.github.io/devcontainer/install.sh | sh -s -- /tmp/my-project
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404
```

We will release that script through GitHub packages or pages? Or point towards the latest stable version of the file, e.g. https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/blob/main/install.sh (which will only exist after this PR is merged)?

### [Comment #4](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/22#issuecomment-3715050651) by [@gerchowl](https://github.com/gerchowl)

_Posted on January 6, 2026 at 03:05 PM_

@c-vigo Good catch! The URL `https://vig-os.github.io/devcontainer/install.sh` requires GitHub Pages to be set up, which doesn't exist yet.

**Options:**

1. **Raw GitHub URL** (works after merge to main):
   ```bash
   curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vig-os/devcontainer/main/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Set up GitHub Pages** (requires repo admin) - host the script at the prettier URL

3. **GitHub Releases** - attach `install.sh` to each release

**Recommendation:** Use the raw GitHub URL for now - it's simpler and works immediately after merge. I'll update the README to use:
```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vig-os/devcontainer/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Also note:** The install script requires the **new image** with `--no-prompts` support in `init-workspace.sh`. Until we push v0.2.0, the remote `latest` image has the old script that requires `-it` (interactive terminal). After `just push version=0.2.0`, it will work.

Also confirmed: all tests pass on my end with the new `init.sh` changes on macOS. ✅
