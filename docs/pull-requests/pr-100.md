# [PR 100](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/100) fix(ci): fix sync-issues schedule trigger and align with dev

## Summary

- Fix broken schedule trigger: `github.event.inputs.target-branch` is null on schedule events, causing `TARGET_BRANCH` to resolve to `refs/heads/` (404 in commit-action). Added `|| 'dev'` fallbacks for all input references.
- Align workflow with `dev` branch improvements: pinned action SHAs, `ubuntu-22.04`, `timeout-minutes: 10`, top-level `permissions: {}`, removed stale cache restore-key prefix.
- Add `output-dir` and `commit-msg` as parameterized `workflow_dispatch` inputs (defaults: `docs` and `chore: sync issues and PRs`). Existing callers (`release.yml`, `post-release.yml`) are unaffected since they only pass `target-branch`.
- Remove stale `.github_data/` directory (31 files) superseded by `docs/` output directory.

Closes #91

## Test plan

- [x] Trigger workflow manually via `workflow_dispatch` with default inputs -- verify it checks out `dev`, syncs to `docs/`, and commits to `dev`
- [x] Trigger with explicit `target-branch` (e.g. a test branch) -- verify it respects the override
- [x] Verify `release.yml` and `post-release.yml` dispatch calls still work (no input changes needed)
- [ ] Wait for next scheduled run (2:00 AM UTC) to confirm automatic fallback to `dev`
