# [PR 62](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/62) feat: add agent-friendly issue templates, changelog rule, and PR template enhancements (#61)

# Pull Request

## Description

Add agent-friendly issue templates, a Cursor rule for changelog updates, and PR template enhancements to close the coding agent workflow loop — from issue creation through commit to pull request.

Currently, coding agents have no guidance on when/how to update the changelog, no signal for which changelog category applies, and no structured templates for refactoring, documentation, or CI/build work. This PR addresses all of those gaps.

## Related Issue(s)

Closes #61

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [ ] CI / Build change
- [ ] Test updates

## Changes Made

### New files
- **`.cursor/rules/changelog.mdc`** — Always-applied Cursor rule guiding agents on when, where, and how to update CHANGELOG.md (categories, entry format, relationship to issue template fields)
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/refactor.yml`** — Refactoring template with scope/out-of-scope/invariants/acceptance criteria
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.yml`** — Documentation template encoding `docs/templates/` + `just docs` workflow
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ci_build.yml`** — CI/Build template with target workflows, trigger types, release pipeline impact
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`** — Template chooser: disables blank issues, links to project docs

### Modified files
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`** — Added Changelog Category dropdown (default: Fixed)
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`** — Added Changelog Category dropdown (default: Added)
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml`** — Added Changelog Category dropdown (full category list)
- **`.github/pull_request_template.md`** — Added Changelog Entry section, CI/Build change type, updated checklist to reference `docs/templates/` and `just docs`
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — Added entry under `## Unreleased / ### Added`

## Changelog Entry

### Added

- **Agent-friendly issue templates, changelog rule, and PR template enhancements** ([#61](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/61))
  - Cursor rule `.cursor/rules/changelog.mdc` (always applied) guiding agents on when, where, and how to update CHANGELOG.md
  - Changelog Category dropdown added to `bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`, and `task.yml` issue templates
  - New issue templates: `refactor.yml` (scope/invariants), `documentation.yml` (docs/templates workflow), `ci_build.yml` (target workflows/triggers/release impact)
  - Template chooser `config.yml` disabling blank issues and linking to project docs
  - PR template enhanced with explicit Changelog Entry section, CI/Build change type, and updated checklist referencing `docs/templates/` and `just docs`

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`) — no test changes; this is template/config only
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

- All pre-commit hooks passed (yaml lint, pymarkdown, branch-name, commit message validation)
- Verified YAML syntax of all new/modified issue templates
- Verified changelog entry follows existing format

## Checklist

- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly (edit `docs/templates/`, then run `just docs`)
- [x] I have updated `CHANGELOG.md` in the `[Unreleased]` section (and pasted the entry above)
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged and published

## Additional Notes

- The `feature_request.yml` template currently uses `labels: ['enhancement']` but the repo label is `feature`. This mismatch predates this PR and is not addressed here — consider a follow-up to align template labels with repo labels.
- No test changes are needed since this is purely templates and Cursor rules (no executable code).
