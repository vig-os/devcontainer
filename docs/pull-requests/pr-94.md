# [PR 94](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/94) fix(tests): bump expected gh version to 2.87 (#93)

## Description

Updates the `gh` CLI version assertion in `test_gh_version` from `2.86.` to `2.87.` to match GitHub CLI 2.87.0 (released 2026-02-18), which was causing CI failures. Also moves the `EXPECTED_VERSIONS` dict to the top of `test_image.py` for better readability.

## Related Issue(s)

Closes #93

## Type of Change

- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [x] Test updates

## Changes Made

- `tests/test_image.py`: bump `gh` expected version prefix from `2.86.` to `2.87.`; move `EXPECTED_VERSIONS` dict above helper functions for better discoverability
- `CHANGELOG.md`: add entry under Unreleased / Fixed for issue #93

## Testing

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [ ] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

CI-only fix — verified by re-running the failing `TestSystemTools::test_gh_version` test against an image built with gh 2.87.0.
