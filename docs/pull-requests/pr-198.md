# [PR 198](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/198) chore: declare worktree prerequisites in setup requirements

## Description

This PR declares missing host-level worktree prerequisites in setup requirements so `scripts/init.sh --check` catches them before `just worktree-start` or `just worktree-attach` fail at runtime.

It also updates generated contributor/user docs to reflect the new dependency requirements and the current command listing output.

## Type of Change

- [ ] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [x] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- `scripts/requirements.yaml`
  - Add required host dependencies for worktree workflow: `jq`, `tmux`, and `agent`
  - Add check/install metadata so `scripts/init.sh --check` validates these tools
- `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Add `## Unreleased` `### Fixed` entry for issue `#196`
- `CONTRIBUTE.md`
  - Sync dependency table and install examples to include `jq`, `tmux`, and `agent`
  - Sync command listing snippets to current output
- `README.md`
  - Sync command listing snippets to current output

## Changelog Entry

### Fixed
- **Worktree prerequisites are declared in setup requirements** ([#196](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/196))
  - Add `tmux`, `agent`, and `jq` to `scripts/requirements.yaml` as required host dependencies with install guidance
  - `scripts/init.sh --check` now surfaces missing worktree prerequisites before running worktree commands

## Testing

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

- Ran `./scripts/init.sh --check`
- Verified preflight now reports missing `tmux` and `agent` in this host environment before running worktree commands
- Verified `jq` is recognized as installed in this host environment
