# [PR 139](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/139) feat(gh-issues): make issue and PR numbers clickable links

## Description

Enhance the `#` column in the `just gh-issues` overview table so that issue and PR numbers are clickable hyperlinks. Uses Rich's `[link=URL]text[/link]` markup for OSC 8 hyperlinks, which work in iTerm2, Windows Terminal, Cursor's integrated terminal, and other modern terminals.

Closes #104

## Type of Change

- [x] `feat` -- New feature

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- Added `_gh_link(owner_repo, num, kind)` helper in `scripts/gh_issues.py` to generate Rich hyperlink markup
- Thread `owner_repo` from `main()` to `_build_table` and `_build_pr_table`
- Issue `#` column: links to `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{num}`
- PR `#` column: links to `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{num}`
- Unit tests in `tests/test_gh_issues.py` for link formatting

## Changelog Entry

```
### Changed

- **Clickable issue and PR numbers in gh-issues table** ([#104](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/104))
  - `#` column in issue and PR tables now uses Rich OSC 8 hyperlinks to GitHub URLs
  - Clicking an issue or PR number opens it in the browser (or Cursor's integrated terminal)
```

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`uv run pytest tests/test_gh_issues.py tests/test_utils.py -v`)
- [x] Manual testing: `just gh-issues` displays tables with clickable numbers

### Manual Testing Details

Ran `uv run python scripts/gh_issues.py` — tables render correctly; issue and PR numbers are hyperlinked in terminals that support OSC 8.
