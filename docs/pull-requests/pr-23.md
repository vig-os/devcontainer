# [PR 23](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/23) Release 0.2.0

This PR includes the release of version 0.2.0 along with bug fixes and documentation improvements.

## Changes

### Bug Fixes

**Fix just argument and enhance version tag handling in push script** (`d75aa80`)
- Fixed test command invocation in the push process by correcting `just` argument syntax
  - Changed from `just test-image version=$VERSION` to `just test-image "$VERSION"`
  - This resolves the issue where tests failed with "invalid reference format" errors
- Enhanced version tag detection to support both `vX.Y.Z` and `vX.Y` formats
  - Normalizes version tags to `X.Y.Z` format for accurate comparison
  - Preserves original tag format for display purposes
  - Fixes issue where existing tags like `v0.1` were not detected during version validation

### Documentation

**Add auto-generated preamble to all doc templates** (`81d186e`)
- Added auto-generated preamble sections to documentation templates
- Updated `CONTRIBUTE.md`, `TESTING.md`, and their corresponding templates
- Ensures consistent documentation structure across generated files

### Release

**Release 0.2.0** (`ad04171`)
- Built and published container image version 0.2.0
- Updated README with new version information

## Testing

- [x] Image build and push process verified
- [x] Version tag detection works with both `vX.Y` and `vX.Y.Z` formats
- [x] Test commands execute correctly with proper argument passing

## Impact

These fixes ensure that:
1. The push script correctly detects existing version tags regardless of format
2. Tests can be run successfully during the release process
3. Documentation maintains consistent formatting
