# [PR 106](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/106) feat(worktree): add optional reviewer parameter to worktree-start

## Summary

This PR adds an optional `reviewer` parameter to the `worktree-start` just recipe, explicitly forbids agents from adding the Cursor co-author trailer, and fixes trust-related stalls in autonomous worktree pipelines.

## Changes Made

### Reviewer Parameter
- **`justfile.worktree`**: Added `reviewer=""` parameter to `worktree-start`. Passed into the tmux session via `-e "PR_REVIEWER=$REVIEWER"`.
- **`.cursor/skills/worktree:pr/SKILL.md`**: Updated to append `--reviewer "$PR_REVIEWER"` to `gh pr create` if set.

### Co-author Prohibition
- Updated all relevant skill files to explicitly state: **NEVER add 'Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>'** to commit messages.

### Trust and Autonomous Reliability
- **`justfile.worktree`**: Added `--trust` and `--approve-mcps` flags to `agent chat` invocations within tmux sessions. This ensures autonomous pipelines do not stall on trust or MCP approval prompts.
- Mirrored all changes to `assets/workspace/`.

### Documentation
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: Added entry for the new feature.

## Test Plan

Verified by running `just --show worktree-start` to ensure flags and environment variables are correctly propagated.
