# [PR 149](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/149) fix(gh-issues): PR table Reviewer column distinguishes requested vs completed

## Description

Fixes the Reviewer column in `just gh-issues` PR table to distinguish between requested reviewers (asked but not yet reviewed) and actual reviewers (submitted a review). Requested reviewers now display as `?login` with dim italic style; actual reviewers remain plain login with green/red for approved/changes requested.

## Type of Change

<!-- Mark the relevant option(s) with an 'x' -->

- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
