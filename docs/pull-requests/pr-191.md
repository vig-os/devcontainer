# [PR 191](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/191) fix(workspace): sync scripts referenced by justfiles into manifest (#190)

## Summary

Fixes #190 — scripts referenced by synced justfiles and pre-commit were not deployed to workspaces.

## Changes

1. **Manifest entries** — Add resolve-branch.sh, derive-branch-summary.sh, check-skill-names.sh to `scripts/manifest.toml` with dest `.devcontainer/scripts/`

2. **Path resolution** — Update justfile.worktree to use `source_directory() / "scripts"` instead of `$(pwd)/scripts/`:
   - Devcontainer repo: `source_directory()` = repo root → `scripts/` ✓
   - Deployed workspace: `source_directory()` = `.devcontainer/` → `.devcontainer/scripts/` ✓

3. **Pre-commit transform** — Add Sed transform to update check-skill-names.sh path from `scripts/` to `.devcontainer/scripts/` in synced `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

## Note

Issue #190 lists devc-remote.sh as a fourth script; it does not exist in the current codebase. The three scripts that exist are now synced. If devc-remote.sh is added later, a manifest entry can be added in a follow-up.

## Verification

- `uv run python scripts/sync_manifest.py sync assets/workspace/` — all entries sync successfully
- `just -f justfile.worktree --list` — parses correctly
- `uv run pytest tests/test_transforms.py tests/test_utils.py` — 78 passed
