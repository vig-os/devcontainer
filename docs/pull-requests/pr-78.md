# [PR 78](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/78) feat(vigutils): add --require-scope flag and strict-by-default hook config

## Summary

- Add `--require-scope` CLI flag to `validate-commit-msg` to mandate that all commits include at least one scope; scopeless commits are rejected when the flag is set
- Configure the workspace `validate-commit-msg` hook with explicit default args (strict-by-default) instead of commented-out examples, lowering the barrier to enforcement for new projects
- Document all CLI flags including `--require-scope` in the `vig-utils` README

## Test plan

- [ ] `--require-scope` rejects commits without a scope (e.g. `feat: description`)
- [ ] `--require-scope` accepts commits with one or more scopes (e.g. `feat(api): description`)
- [ ] Existing tests still pass (`uv run pytest packages/vig-utils/tests/test_validate_commit_msg.py`)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks run cleanly against the repo (`uv run pre-commit run --all-files`)
