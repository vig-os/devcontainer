# [PR 182](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/182) fix(gh-issues): make issue numbers in PR table clickable hyperlinks

## Summary

- Replace `_styled(f"#{n}", "cyan")` with `_gh_link(owner_repo, n, "issues")` in `_build_pr_table`
- Issue numbers in the PR table's "Issues" column are now clickable hyperlinks (consistent with PR numbers and issue table)
- Minor display change: numbers no longer have `#` prefix (matches `_gh_link` convention used elsewhere)

## Test plan

- [x] Failing regression test added (`TestBuildPrTableIssueLinks`)
- [x] Test passes after fix
- [x] All 68 existing tests pass
- [ ] Manual verification: `just gh-issues` shows clickable issue links in PR table

Refs: #174
