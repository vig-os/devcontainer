# [PR 151](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/151) feat(justfile): add devcontainer and git recipes to justfile.base (#71)

## Description

Expands `justfile.base` with devcontainer lifecycle and git helper recipes per the scoped implementation plan. Developers can now run `just up`, `just down`, `just status`, etc. from the host to manage the devcontainer, and `just log` / `just branch` for quick git diagnostics.

## Type of Change

- [x] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- **`assets/workspace/.devcontainer/justfile.base`** — Added devcontainer group (host-side): `up`, `down`, `status`, `logs`, `shell`, `restart`, `open`; auto-detect podman/docker compose; host-only guard. Added git group: `log` (pretty one-line, last 20), `branch` (current + recent).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — Added entry under ## Unreleased.

## Changelog Entry

### Added

- **Devcontainer and git recipes in justfile.base** ([#71](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/71))
  - Devcontainer group (host-side only): `up`, `down`, `status`, `logs`, `shell`, `restart`, `open`
  - Auto-detect podman/docker compose; graceful failure if run inside container
  - Git group: `log` (pretty one-line, last 20), `branch` (current + recent)

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test` — unit tests; integration tests pass except pre-existing `test_just_gh_issues` failure due to missing `rich` in test env)
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

- `just --list` from `assets/workspace` shows all new recipes (devcontainer, git groups)
- `just log` and `just branch` run successfully from workspace root
