# [PR 175](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/175) fix(gh-issues): make PR table Issues column clickable links

## Description

Makes issue numbers in the PR table "Issues" column clickable terminal hyperlinks. Previously they were styled with cyan but not clickable. The fix replaces `_styled` with `_gh_link` for consistency with how PR numbers and issue numbers elsewhere in the dashboard are rendered.

## Type of Change

<!-- Mark the relevant option(s) with an 'x' -->

- [ ] `feat` -- New feature
- [x] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- `scripts/gh_issues.py` — Add `_format_pr_issues_cell` helper, use `_gh_link` instead of `_styled` for issues cell in `_build_pr_table`
- `tests/test_gh_issues.py` — Add `TestFormatPrIssuesCell` tests for clickable link markup

## Changelog Entry

<!-- Paste the exact entry you added to CHANGELOG.md under ## Unreleased.
     If no changelog update is needed, write "No changelog needed" and explain why.
     Example:
     ### Added
     - **SSH agent forwarding** ([#42](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/42))
       - Forward host SSH agent into devcontainer for seamless git authentication
-->

### Fixed

- **Issue numbers in PR table Issues column are not clickable links** ([#174](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/174))
  - Replace `_styled` with `_gh_link` in `_build_pr_table` so issue numbers render as clickable terminal hyperlinks

## Testing

<!-- Describe the tests you ran and how to verify your changes -->
- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [ ] Manual testing performed (describe below)
