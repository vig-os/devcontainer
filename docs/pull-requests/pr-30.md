# [PR 30](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/30) fix: implement proper multi-arch support in publish workflow

## Summary

This PR enhances the `publish-container-image.yml` workflow with architecture validation and dynamic architecture selection. Users can now specify which architectures to build (amd64, arm64, or both) when manually triggering the workflow, with comprehensive validation to ensure only valid architectures are processed.

## Changes

### 1. Architecture Input Validation
- **New Job**: `validate-architectures` (lines 103-160)
  - Parses comma-separated architecture input from workflow_dispatch
  - Validates each architecture against allowed values: `amd64`, `arm64`
  - Rejects invalid architectures with clear error messages
  - Checks for duplicate architectures
  - Generates dynamic JSON matrix for build job

### 2. Dynamic Build Matrix
- **Updated**: `build` job now uses dynamic matrix from validation
  - `matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.validate-architectures.outputs.matrix) }}`
  - Builds only the architectures specified by the user
  - For tag pushes, always builds both architectures (default behavior)

### 3. Smart Manifest Creation
- **Enhanced**: `manifest` job dynamically handles built architectures
  - Verifies and includes only the architectures that were actually built
  - Creates version-specific manifest with selected architectures
  - Updates `latest` tag only for tag pushes with both architectures
  - Skips `latest` tag for single-architecture or manual workflow runs

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Fixed default architecture value: `'amd64,arm'` → `'amd64,arm64'`
- Fixed ARM runner name: `'ubuntu-22.04-arm'` → `'ubuntu-22.04-arm64'`

## Usage Examples

### Manual Workflow Dispatch

**Build only amd64:**
```yaml
architectures: amd64
```

**Build only arm64:**
```yaml
architectures: arm64
```

**Build both (default):**
```yaml
architectures: amd64,arm64
```

### Tag Pushes
- Always builds both architectures (`amd64,arm64`)
- Creates multi-arch manifest and updates `latest` tag

## Validation Behavior

### Valid Inputs
- `amd64`
- `arm64`
- `amd64,arm64`
- `arm64,amd64`
- `amd64, arm64` (spaces are removed)

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can test single-architecture builds without waiting for both
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Save CI minutes by building only needed architectures during development
3. **Safety**: Validation prevents typos and invalid architecture specifications
4. **Clear Errors**: Comprehensive error messages guide users to correct inputs
5. **Smart Defaults**: Tag pushes always build both architectures for production releases

## Testing

The changes can be tested by:
1. Manual workflow dispatch with different architecture combinations
2. Verifying validation errors for invalid inputs
3. Checking that tag pushes still build both architectures

## Documentation Updated

- Updated CHANGELOG.md for version 0.2.1
- Added architecture validation feature documentation

## Related Issues

Closes #[issue-number] (if applicable)
