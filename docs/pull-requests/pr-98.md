# [PR 98](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/98) chore: merge main into dev to apply changes from #91

## Summary

Merge `main` back into `dev` to synchronize changes that landed on `main` via #91:

- **Reduce sync-issues workflow frequency** — removed `issues` and `pull_request` event triggers from `sync-issues.yml`, keeping only the daily schedule (`0 2 * * *`) and `workflow_dispatch`. Simplifies target branch logic by removing the now-unnecessary "Determine target branch" step.

## Conflict Resolution

The `dev` branch had additional hardening changes to `sync-issues.yml` (pinned action SHAs, `ubuntu-22.04`, `timeout-minutes`, restrictive top-level `permissions`, `output-dir: 'docs'`). The merge conflict was resolved by keeping all of `dev`'s security hardening while applying `main`'s trigger simplification.

Supersedes #97 (which had an unresolvable conflict due to head being `main` itself).

## Tests

- [x] Verify the `sync-issues.yml` workflow no longer triggers on issue/PR events
- [x] Verify `workflow_dispatch` with `target-branch` input still works (used by `release.yml` and `post-release.yml`)
- [x] All pre-commit hooks pass (yamllint, check-action-pins, etc.)

Refs: #91
