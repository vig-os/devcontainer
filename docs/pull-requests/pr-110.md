Thanks for the contribution, @nacholiya! The Containerfile change is exactly right.

I've adopted your commit (preserving your authorship) onto the branch `feature/108-install-cursor-agent-cli` which follows our branch naming convention (`<type>/<issue>-<summary>`) and targets `dev` instead of `main` per our [branching strategy](docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md#branching-strategy). I also added the CHANGELOG entry and `Refs: #108` reference.

Closing this in favor of the new PR — your commit and authorship are fully preserved there. Thanks again!
