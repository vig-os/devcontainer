# [PR 167](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/167) fix(deps): add rich to dev dependency group (#159)

## Description

Fixes `just gh-issues` failing on local development machines by adding `rich` to the dev dependency group in `pyproject.toml`. This ensures `uv sync` installs `rich` into the project `.venv`, making the script work both locally and inside the devcontainer.

## Type of Change

- [x] `fix` -- Bug fix

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- `pyproject.toml` — Added `rich>=13.0.0` to `[dependency-groups] dev`
- `uv.lock` — Updated lockfile with rich dependency
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Added entry under Fixed section

## Changelog Entry

### Fixed

- **just gh-issues fails locally — rich not in .venv dependencies** ([#159](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/159))
  - Add `rich>=13.0.0` to dev dependency group in `pyproject.toml` so `uv sync` installs it into `.venv`

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [ ] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

Verified that `rich` is installed after `uv sync --group dev` and can be imported with `uv run python3 -c "from rich.table import Table"`. The dependency is now declared in `pyproject.toml` dev group, ensuring it's available when developers run `uv sync`.
