# [PR 118](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/118) chore: remove manual sync-issues workflow triggers from skills

# Pull Request

## Description

Remove fire-and-forget `gh workflow run sync-issues.yml` trigger steps from four skills. The sync-issues workflow now runs on a 24h cron schedule, making these inline triggers unnecessary.

## Related Issue(s)

Closes #101

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [x] CI / Build change
- [ ] Test updates

## Changes Made

- **`worktree:plan/SKILL.md`** — Removed step 5 (sync-issues trigger). Steps renumbered 1–4.
- **`worktree:brainstorm/SKILL.md`** — Removed substep 4 under "Publish design as a GitHub issue comment".
- **`design:brainstorm/SKILL.md`** — Removed substep 4 under "Publish design". Reworded H2-header rationale comment (was referencing sync workflow, now explains purpose for skill detection).
- **`design:plan/SKILL.md`** — Removed step 5 (sync-issues trigger). Reworded H2-header rationale comment to match.

## Changelog Entry

No changelog needed — internal skill maintenance with no user-visible impact (issue is labeled `chore` with "No changelog needed" category).

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`) — N/A, markdown-only changes
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

- Verified `grep -c 'sync-issues'` returns 0 for all four files
- Verified step numbering is sequential and correct in each file
- Pre-commit hooks (including pymarkdown linter) passed

- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly (edit `docs/templates/`, then run `just docs`)

- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works

## Additional Notes

Pure documentation/skill maintenance. No functional code changes. No tests needed — these are markdown workflow instructions.
