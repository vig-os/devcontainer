# [PR 95](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/95) chore: reduce sync-issues workflow frequency and simplify triggers

## Summary

- Changes cron schedule from `0 0 * * *` (midnight UTC) to `0 2 * * *` (2:00 AM UTC)
- Removes event-based triggers (`issues` and `pull_request` events) — workflow now only runs on schedule or manual dispatch
- Removes the dynamic `Determine target branch` step; branch is now taken directly from the `workflow_dispatch` input (`target-branch`, defaulting to `dev`)
- Simplifies `target-branch` input description to reflect supported values (`dev`, `release/x.y.z`)

Closes #91

## Test plan (only possible after merge)

- [ ] Verify workflow runs correctly on the daily schedule at 2:00 AM UTC
- [ ] Trigger manually via `workflow_dispatch` without specifying a branch — confirm it checks out `dev`
- [ ] Trigger manually via `workflow_dispatch` with a specific branch — confirm it checks out the specified branch
