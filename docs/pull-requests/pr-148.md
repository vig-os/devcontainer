# [PR 148](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/148) feat(skills): use PR template in pr_create and worktree_pr (#147)

## Description

Updates `pr_create` and `worktree_pr` skills to read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and fill each section from available context, instead of composing freeform PR bodies. Ensures autonomous PRs match manual PR structure and include all checklist items (Type of Change, Changelog Entry, Testing, Checklist, Refs).

## Type of Change

- [x] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- `.cursor/skills/pr_create/SKILL.md` — Step 4: replaced vague "use structure" with explicit read-then-fill procedure
- `.cursor/skills/worktree_pr/SKILL.md` — Step 5: same replacement
- `assets/workspace/.cursor/skills/pr_create/SKILL.md` — synced with primary
- `assets/workspace/.cursor/skills/worktree_pr/SKILL.md` — synced with primary
- `CHANGELOG.md` — added entry under Changed

## Changelog Entry

### Changed

- **Autonomous PR skills use pull request template** ([#147](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/147))
  - `pr_create` and `worktree_pr` now read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and fill each section from available context
  - Explicit read-then-fill procedure with section-by-section mapping (Description, Type of Change, Changelog Entry, Testing, Checklist, Refs)
  - Ensures autonomous PRs match manual PR structure and include all checklist items

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [ ] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

N/A — documentation/instruction-only change. Verification: next autonomous PR should match template structure.

## Checklist

- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines
- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly (edit `docs/templates/`, then run `just docs`)
- [x] I have updated `CHANGELOG.md` in the `[Unreleased]` section (and pasted the entry above)
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged and published

## Additional Notes

Design: see issue #147 Design comment. Documentation-only change per design — no testable code, TDD skipped.
