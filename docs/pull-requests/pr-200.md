# [PR 200](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/200) refactor: move alias definitions to source justfiles and add file associations (#195)

## Description

Move alias definitions from the centralized top-level `justfile` to their respective source justfiles (`justfile.podman`, `justfile.worktree`, `justfile.gh`), improving modularity and reducing drift between imported files and alias declarations. Also add permanent editor file associations so `just-lsp` recognizes `justfile`, `Justfile`, and `just.*` files.

## Type of Change

- [ ] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [x] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- **justfile**: Removed the centralized alias section (28 lines). All 16 aliases moved to their source modules.
- **justfile.podman**: Added 10 `pdm-*` aliases for podman recipes.
- **justfile.worktree**: Added 5 `wt-*` aliases for worktree recipes.
- **justfile.gh**: Added 1 `gh-i` alias for the github issues recipe.
- **.vscode/settings.json**: Added `files.associations` for `justfile`, `Justfile`, and `just.*` so `just-lsp` recognizes all justfile variants.

## Changelog Entry

No changelog needed. This is an internal refactor with no observable behavior change -- all aliases remain available and the `just --list` output is identical before and after.

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

- Ran `just --list` before and after, diffed outputs: identical (zero differences).
- Ran `just --evaluate` to confirm all justfiles parse correctly.
- Ran `just lint`: all checks passed.
- Ran `just precommit`: all hooks pass except pre-existing `branch-name` hook (branch naming convention).
- Ran `just test-utils`: 76 tests passed.

- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly (edit `docs/templates/`, then run `just docs`)
