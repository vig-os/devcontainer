# [PR 146](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/146) feat(gh-issues): show CI status and failure details in PR table

## Description

Adds a **CI status column** to the `just gh-issues` PR table, showing pass/fail/pending summary per PR with failed check names and a clickable link to the GitHub checks page. Uses `statusCheckRollup` from `gh pr list` JSON — zero extra API calls.

## Type of Change

- [x] `feat` -- New feature

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- **`scripts/gh_issues.py`**
  - Added `statusCheckRollup` to `_fetch_prs()` JSON field list
  - New `_format_ci_status(pr, owner_repo)` function: summarizes checks as `✓ 6/6` (green), `⏳ 3/6` (yellow), or `✗ 5/6 Failed Check` (red); returns Rich markup with clickable link to PR checks tab
  - Added CI column to `_build_pr_table` before the Review column
- **`tests/test_gh_issues.py`**
  - Added `TestFormatCiStatus` test class covering: all passed, failures with names, in-progress, empty/missing rollup, neutral/skipped conclusions, missing fields
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**
  - Added entry under `## Unreleased` → `### Added`

## Changelog Entry

### Added
- **CI status column in just gh-issues PR table** ([#143](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/143))
  - PR table shows CI column with pass/fail/pending summary (✓ 6/6, ⏳ 3/6, ✗ 5/6)
  - Failed check names visible when checks fail
  - CI cell links to GitHub PR checks page

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [ ] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

TDD workflow: failing tests committed first (`c23ed1d`), then implementation committed (`ae377de`). 64/64 tests passing.

## Additional Notes

Design approved in [issue comment](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/143#issuecomment-3939573343). Implementation uses a single pure function (`_format_ci_status`) consistent with existing patterns like `_infer_review` and `_extract_reviewers`.
