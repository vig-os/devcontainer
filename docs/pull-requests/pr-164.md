# [PR 164](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/164) fix: reject AI agent identity fingerprints in validate-commit-msg

## Description

Extend `validate-commit-msg` to actively reject commits containing AI agent identity fingerprints (Co-authored-by trailers, cursoragent, claude, codex, chatgpt, copilot). The commit-msg hook now blocks these patterns before any other validation.

Closes #163

## Type of Change

- [x] `fix` -- Bug fix

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- Added `_contains_agent_fingerprint()` to scan full commit message for blocklist patterns
- Blocklist: Co-authored-by, cursoragent, claude, codex, chatgpt, copilot (case-insensitive; agent names as whole words)
- Agent check runs first, before subject/body/Refs validation
- 6 new tests in `TestAgentFingerprints` (TDD)

## Changelog Entry

### Fixed

- **validate-commit-msg rejects AI agent identity fingerprints** ([#163](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/163))
  - Commit-msg hook now rejects commits containing Co-authored-by, cursoragent, claude, codex, chatgpt, copilot
  - Enforced before other validation; applies to full message including subject-only mode

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`uv run pytest packages/vig-utils/tests/test_validate_commit_msg.py` — 121 passed)
- [x] Manual testing: commit with `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` rejected

### Manual Testing Details

```bash
echo -e "feat: add x\n\nRefs: #163\n\nCo-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>" > /tmp/msg
uv run validate-commit-msg /tmp/msg
# Exit 1, error about agent fingerprint
```
