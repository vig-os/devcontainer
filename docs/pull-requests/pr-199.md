# [PR 199](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/199) refactor(workspace): move alias definitions to source justfiles

## Summary
- **Move alias ownership** from centralized top-level `justfile` to their respective source justfiles (`justfile.podman`, `justfile.worktree`, `justfile.gh`), improving modularity and reducing drift between imported files and alias declarations.
- **Add permanent file associations** in `.vscode/settings.json` so `just-lsp` recognizes `justfile`, `Justfile`, and `just.*` patterns.
- **Add regression test suite** (`tests/bats/justfile-aliases.bats`) verifying all 16 aliases resolve correctly after the move.

## Test plan
- [x] All 16 alias resolution tests pass (`npx bats tests/bats/justfile-aliases.bats`)
- [x] Existing `wt-clean` alias test passes (`worktree.bats:235`)
- [x] Full BATS suite passes (33/33)
- [x] All pre-commit hooks pass
- [x] `just --list` shows aliases inline on their source recipes
- [x] Workspace assets synced and verified

Closes #195
