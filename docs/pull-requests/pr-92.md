# [PR 92](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/92) fix: drop v prefix from release tags (#57)

## Description

Removes the `v` prefix from all git release tags to align with the tag convention defined in issue #57. Tags now follow the bare `X.Y.Z` format (e.g. `1.0.0` instead of `v1.0.0`). Existing repository tags were renamed accordingly.

## Related Issue(s)

Closes #57

## Type of Change

- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)

## Changes Made

- **`release.yml`** — tag creation, push, validation, and rollback updated to use bare `X.Y.Z` format
- **`prepare-release.yml`** — tag existence check, PR title, and PR body updated to drop `v` prefix
- **`assets/workspace/.github/workflows/release.yml`** — workspace template updated to match
- **`.github/actions/build-image/action.yml`** — example `release-url` comment updated
- **`docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md`**, **`CONTRIBUTE.md`**, **`README.md`**, **`docs/generate.py`**, **`docs/templates/CONTRIBUTE.md.j2`** — documentation and templates updated throughout
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — historical release links updated to bare-version URLs; Unreleased section documents the fix and tag renames

## Testing

- [x] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

Tag convention change is purely in workflow scripts and documentation. No runtime logic is affected. Verified all `v`-prefixed references are removed across CI workflows, templates, and docs.
