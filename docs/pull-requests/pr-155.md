# [PR 155](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/155) feat(scripts): devc_remote_uri.py — Cursor URI construction for remote devcontainers (#153)

## Description

Adds `scripts/devc_remote_uri.py` — a standalone Python module/CLI that builds the Cursor/VS Code nested authority URI for remote devcontainers. Part of #70. Opening Cursor/VS Code into a remote devcontainer requires constructing a `vscode-remote://` URI with hex-encoded JSON specs; Python handles this cleanly with stdlib only.

## Type of Change

<!-- Mark the relevant option(s) with an 'x' -->

- [x] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [ ] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- **scripts/devc_remote_uri.py** (new): `hex_encode()`, `build_uri()`, CLI with argparse
- **tests/test_devc_remote_uri.py** (new): 11 pytest unit tests (hex_encode, build_uri, CLI, edge cases)
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Added entry under ## Unreleased

## Changelog Entry

<!-- Paste the exact entry you added to CHANGELOG.md under ## Unreleased.
     If no changelog update is needed, write "No changelog needed" and explain why.
     Example:
     ### Added
     - **SSH agent forwarding** ([#42](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/42))
       - Forward host SSH agent into devcontainer for seamless git authentication
-->

### Added

- **devc_remote_uri.py — Cursor URI construction for remote devcontainers** ([#153](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/153))
  - Standalone Python module with `hex_encode()` and `build_uri()` for vscode-remote URIs
  - CLI: `devc_remote_uri.py <workspace_path> <ssh_host> <container_workspace>` prints URI to stdout
  - Stdlib only (json, argparse); called by devc-remote.sh (sibling sub-issue)

## Testing

<!-- Describe the tests you ran and how to verify your changes -->
- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test`)
- [ ] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

<!-- If applicable, describe manual testing steps -->

N/A — `uv run pytest tests/test_devc_remote_uri.py -v` passes (11 tests). `just lint` passes.
