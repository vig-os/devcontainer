# [PR 97](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/97) chore: merge main into dev to apply changes from #91

## Summary

Merge `main` back into `dev` to synchronize changes that landed on `main` via #91:

- **Reduce sync-issues workflow frequency** — removed `issues` and `pull_request` event triggers from `sync-issues.yml`, keeping only the daily schedule (`0 2 * * *`) and `workflow_dispatch`. Simplifies target branch logic by removing the now-dead PR-merged-into-main code path.

## Context

After PR #91 was merged into `main`, the `dev` branch is missing the workflow schedule update (`adafdc5`). This PR brings `dev` in sync with `main` to prevent the sync-issues workflow from continuing to fire on every issue/PR state change on `dev`-based branches.

## Tests

- [x] Verify the `sync-issues.yml` workflow no longer triggers on issue/PR events
- [x] Verify `workflow_dispatch` with `target-branch` input still works (used by `release.yml` and `post-release.yml`)

Refs: #91
