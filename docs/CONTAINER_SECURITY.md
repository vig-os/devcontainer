# Container Security Patching Strategy

This document describes how the devcontainer image handles system-level
security vulnerabilities (CVEs) in OS packages.

## Principles

1. **Reproducibility first** – Every build from the same commit must produce
   the same image. Non-deterministic operations (`apt-get upgrade`) are
   forbidden in the default build path.
2. **Defence in depth** – Multiple layers detect and remediate CVEs at
   different speeds so that no single mechanism is a bottleneck.
3. **Minimal blast radius** – When manual patching is necessary, only the
   specific vulnerable package is upgraded, and the change is traceable to a
   CVE identifier.

## Layers of defence

### 1. Base image digest pinning (primary)

The `FROM` line in the Containerfile pins the base image to an immutable
SHA-256 digest:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm@sha256:<digest>
```

Dependabot (configured for the `docker` ecosystem) monitors the upstream image
and opens a pull request whenever a new digest is published. Because the
upstream maintainers rebuild the image to include Debian security patches, most
CVEs are resolved simply by merging the Dependabot PR.

**Typical remediation time:** 1–7 days after the upstream image is rebuilt.

### 2. Weekly Trivy scan (detection)

The scheduled workflow (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`) builds the
image every Monday and runs a full Trivy vulnerability scan. Results are:

- Printed as a table in the workflow log.
- Uploaded as a SARIF report to the GitHub Security tab.
- Accompanied by a CycloneDX SBOM artifact.

This scan is **non-blocking** (exit-code 0) and serves as an early-warning
system for newly published CVEs.

### 3. Targeted package upgrades (escape hatch)

When a HIGH or CRITICAL CVE is detected that:

- Has a fix available in the Debian stable repository, **and**
- Cannot wait for the next base image rebuild (e.g., actively exploited),

a targeted upgrade is added to the Containerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --only-upgrade \
    libfoo=1.2.3-1+deb12u1 \  # CVE-2026-XXXXX
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Rules for targeted upgrades:

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Each package must reference a CVE in a comment | Auditability |
| Pin the package to an exact version | Reproducibility |
| Remove the entry once the base image digest includes the fix | Avoid drift |
| Never use blanket `apt-get upgrade` or `dist-upgrade` | Reproducibility |

### 4. Trivy ignore list (risk acceptance)

Low-risk CVEs that are not exploitable in the devcontainer context are
documented in `.trivyignore` with:

- A risk assessment explaining why the CVE is acceptable.
- An expiration date after which the entry must be re-evaluated.
- A link to the tracking issue.

## Why not `apt-get upgrade`?

Running `apt-get upgrade` (or `dist-upgrade`) in the Containerfile has several
drawbacks:

| Problem | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Non-reproducible builds** | The same Containerfile produces different images on different days because the Debian mirror contents change constantly. |
| **Defeats digest pinning** | The digest guarantees a known starting point; upgrading everything immediately discards that guarantee. |
| **Untraceable changes** | There is no record of *which* packages changed or *why*. A targeted upgrade with a CVE comment is auditable. |
| **`dist-upgrade` risk** | `dist-upgrade` can remove packages or change dependencies, potentially breaking the image silently. |
| **Cache invalidation** | A blanket upgrade invalidates the Docker layer cache on every build, increasing build times. |
