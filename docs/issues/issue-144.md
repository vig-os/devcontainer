# [Issue 144]: [[BUG] generate-docs pre-commit hook misses new skill directories](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/144)

### Description

The `generate-docs` pre-commit hook does not trigger when skill directories are added or modified under `.cursor/skills/`. This means `docs/SKILL_PIPELINE.md` can become stale without the developer noticing during local commits.

### Problem Statement

The hook's `files` filter only matches:

```
^(docs/templates/.*\.j2|docs/narrative/.*\.md|scripts/requirements\.yaml|justfile)$
```

`docs/generate.py` scans `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` to build the skills table in `SKILL_PIPELINE.md`. When a new skill directory is added (e.g. `pr_solve`), the hook does not fire during local commits because the changed files don't match the filter. CI catches it with `--all-files`, but the developer only finds out after pushing.

This caused the CI failure on PR #142.

### Proposed Solution

Add `.cursor/skills/` to the hook's `files` pattern:

```yaml
files: ^(docs/templates/.*\.j2|docs/narrative/.*\.md|scripts/requirements\.yaml|justfile|\.cursor/skills/.*)$
```

This ensures the hook fires whenever skills are added, removed, or modified.

### Alternatives Considered

- **Do nothing** — CI catches it with `--all-files`, but the feedback loop is slow and creates noise.
- **Add `git add docs/SKILL_PIPELINE.md` to the hook entry** — The hook already auto-stages `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTE.md`, and `TESTING.md`, but `SKILL_PIPELINE.md` is missing from the `git add` list. Both the trigger pattern and the staging list should be updated together.

### Impact

Prevents a class of CI failures where generated docs are stale after adding or modifying skills.
