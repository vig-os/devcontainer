# [Issue 178]: [Add [IDLE] status to worktree-list and idle mode to worktree-clean](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/178)

## Problem

`just wt-list` only shows `[RUNNING]` or `[STOPPED]`. When an agent finishes its task but the tmux session remains open (waiting for a new prompt), there's no way to distinguish an actively working agent from an idle one.

`just wt-clean` only supports cleaning stopped worktrees or all worktrees — no way to also clean idle ones while preserving actively running agents.

## Solution

### worktree-list
- Check `#{window_activity}` tmux variable to detect when a session's last output was > N minutes ago (default: 5 min, configurable via `WT_IDLE_MINUTES`)
- Show `[IDLE]` status for sessions with no recent activity

### worktree-clean
- Default (no args): clean stopped worktrees only (unchanged)
- `idle`: clean stopped + idle worktrees
- `all`: clean everything including running (unchanged)

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `just wt-list` shows `[IDLE]` for sessions idle > threshold
- [ ] `just wt-clean` default still cleans only stopped
- [ ] `just wt-clean idle` cleans stopped + idle, skips running
- [ ] `just wt-clean all` cleans everything (unchanged)
- [ ] BATS tests cover new behavior
