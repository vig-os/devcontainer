# [Issue 109]: [[DISCUSSION] Optimize CI pipeline for PRs to dev — full security scan on every PR?](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/109)

### Description

Should the full CI pipeline (including security scans and other long-running jobs) run on every PR to `dev`, or can we slim it down to "it builds & tests pass" for faster feedback?

Currently, PRs to `dev` run the complete CI suite including security scanning, which adds significant time. With the goal of faster PR turnaround, we should discuss whether that's necessary or if a smarter approach exists.

### Context / Motivation

CI runs on PRs to `dev` take a long time, partly due to security scans and other heavyweight checks. For a branch that primarily serves as an integration target (not production), this slows down the development loop without a clear proportional benefit. The question is whether the full suite is justified for every PR to `dev` or only for PRs into `main`.

### Options / Alternatives

1. **Minimal CI on PRs to `dev`** — Only run build + test. Reserve security scans and other heavyweight checks for PRs into `main`.
2. **Smart/conditional CI** — Detect what changed and skip security scans when no new packages or version updates are present. E.g., only trigger security scanning when `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, lock files, or similar dependency files change.
3. **Keep full CI everywhere** — Accept the longer times for maximum safety at every stage.

### Open Questions

- Is "it builds & tests pass" sufficient confidence for merging into `dev`?
- Should security scanning only gate PRs into `main`?
- Can we use path-based triggers (e.g., changes to dependency files) to conditionally run security scans on `dev` PRs?
- Are there other long-running CI jobs besides security that could be deferred to the `main` gate?
