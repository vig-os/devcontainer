# [Issue 27]: [Adopt Nix/devenv for reproducible, auditable dependency management](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/27)

## Summary

Replace the current ad-hoc tooling installation (apt + curl | bash + manual version tracking) with Nix/devenv for declarative, reproducible, and cryptographically verified dependency management. This addresses regulatory requirements for medical device software (IEC 62304, FDA cybersecurity guidance) while eliminating the manual synchronization between `Containerfile` and `EXPECTED_VERSIONS` in tests.

**Key benefits:**
- Single source of truth for all tool versions (`flake.nix` + `flake.lock`)
- Cryptographic hash verification of all dependencies (supply chain security)
- Air-gapped/offline rebuild capability for regulatory compliance
- Automatic SBOM generation from dependency graph
- Reproducible builds years after initial release

---

## Current Pain Points

### 1. Version tracking is manual and fragmented

Versions are scattered across:
- `Containerfile` (implicit "latest" for gh, just, uv via curl)
- `tests/test_image.py` `EXPECTED_VERSIONS` dict (manually maintained)

Updates are reactive—tests fail after rebuild, then we update the test file.

### 2. No reproducibility guarantee

```dockerfile
# Current: fetches "latest" at build time
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to /usr/local/bin
```

Building the same Containerfile 3 months later produces different results.

### 3. Supply chain vulnerabilities

- `curl | bash` patterns trust remote scripts
- apt packages trust Debian mirrors
- No cryptographic verification of most downloads (gh and uv have manual checksum verification, but just does not)

### 4. Regulatory gaps

- No built-in SBOM generation
- Difficult to prove "rebuild from source" capability
- No formal approval workflow for dependency updates

---

## Proposed Solution: Nix/devenv

### What changes

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| `apt-get install git curl` | `packages = [ pkgs.git pkgs.curl ]` |
| `curl \| bash` for tools | Nix packages with pinned hashes |
| `EXPECTED_VERSIONS` in tests | Derived from Nix metadata (or eliminated) |
| Implicit "latest" versions | Explicit pins in `flake.lock` |

### Example `devenv.nix`

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  packages = [
    pkgs.git
    pkgs.curl
    pkgs.gh
    pkgs.just
    pkgs.uv
    pkgs.pre-commit
    pkgs.ruff
  ];

  languages.python = {
    enable = true;
    version = "3.12";
  };
}
```

### `flake.lock` provides cryptographic pins

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "nixpkgs": {
      "locked": {
        "narHash": "sha256-abc123...",
        "rev": "def456..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Regulatory Benefits (IEC 62304 / FDA)

### 1. Air-gapped/offline builds

```bash
# Archive all sources for offline rebuild
nix flake archive --json > archive-manifest.json

# Export binary cache
nix copy --to file:///path/to/offline-cache .#devcontainer
```

Enables "rebuild without internet" for controlled manufacturing environments.

### 2. Supply chain protection

Every dependency is content-addressed:
- Source tarballs verified by SHA256
- Git commits verified by tree hash
- Build outputs verified by content hash

**Hash mismatch = build failure** (detects tampering automatically)

### 3. SBOM generation

```bash
nix derivation show .#devcontainer > sbom.json
```

Complete dependency tree with versions, hashes, and sources.

### 4. Change control

```bash
# Diff between releases shows exactly what changed
diff release-1.0/flake.lock release-1.1/flake.lock
```

`flake.lock` becomes a controlled document for regulatory submissions.

---

## Update Workflow Comparison

| Update type | Current | With Nix |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Patch** | Automatic on rebuild (reactive) | `nix flake update` (proactive, controlled) |
| **Minor** | Automatic, may surprise | Explicit, reviewed before merge |
| **Major** | Manual Containerfile edit + test update | Change one line in `devenv.nix` |
| **Rollback** | Rebuild from git history, hope repos unchanged | `git checkout flake.lock && nix build` (identical) |

### Security updates

- Stable nixpkgs channels backport security fixes
- Automated PRs via Renovate/Dependabot for `flake.lock` updates
- Weekly update cadence recommended

---

## Trade-offs

### Costs

- **Learning curve**: Team needs Nix familiarity
- **Image size**: ~200-400 MB larger (Nix store overhead)
- **Build time**: Initial builds slower (Nix evaluation)

### Mitigations

- Start with hybrid approach (Debian base + Nix for tools)
- Use binary cache to speed up builds
- Incremental adoption possible

---

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Evaluate devenv vs pure flake approach
- [ ] Create `flake.nix` with current tool set
- [ ] Verify all tools available in nixpkgs (gh, just, uv, pre-commit, ruff)
- [ ] Set up binary cache (Cachix or self-hosted)
- [ ] Implement offline archive workflow
- [ ] Update tests to derive expected versions from Nix (or remove version checks)
- [ ] Document regulatory workflows (SBOM generation, approval process)
- [ ] Update CI pipeline
