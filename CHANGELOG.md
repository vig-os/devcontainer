## Unreleased

### Added

- `just` as build automation tool (replaces `make`)
- Layered justfile architecture: `justfile.base` (managed), `justfile.project` (team-shared), `justfile.local` (personal)
- Generic sidecar passthrough: `just sidecar <name> <recipe>` for executing commands in sidecar containers
- Documentation generation system (`docs/generate.py`) with Jinja2 templates
- Python project template with `pyproject.toml` and standard structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`)
- Pre-built Python virtual environment with common dev/science dependencies (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, pytest, jupyter)
- Auto-sync Python dependencies on container attach via `uv sync`
- `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable for instant venv access without rebuild
- `pip-licenses` pre-commit hook for dependency license compliance checking (blocks GPL-3.0/AGPL-3.0)
- Pre-flight container cleanup check in test suite with helpful error messages
- `just clean-test-containers` recipe for removing lingering test containers
- `PYTEST_AUTO_CLEANUP` environment variable for automatic test container cleanup
- `docker-compose.project.yaml` for team-shared configuration (git-tracked, preserved during upgrades)
- `docker-compose.local.yaml` for personal configuration (git-ignored, preserved during upgrades)
- Build-time manifest generation for optimized placeholder replacement
- `tests/CLEANUP.md` documentation for test container management

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `make` with `just` - all build commands now use `just` (e.g., `just test`, `just build`, `just push`)
- VS Code Python interpreter now points to pre-built venv (`/root/assets/workspace/.venv`)
- Test container cleanup check runs once at start of `just test` instead of each test phase
- **BREAKING**: Docker Compose file hierarchy now uses `project.yaml` and `local.yaml` instead of `override.yml`
- Socket detection prioritizes Podman over Docker Desktop on macOS and Linux
- `{{TAG}}` placeholder replacement moved to container with build-time manifest generation (significantly faster initialization)
- Placeholder replacement logic now runs in container at build time instead of at runtime
- Socket mount configuration uses environment variable with fallback: `${CONTAINER_SOCKET_PATH:-/var/run/docker.sock}`
- `initialize.sh` writes socket path to `.env` file instead of modifying YAML directly
- `init-workspace.sh` simplified: removed cross-platform `sed` handling (always runs in Linux)

### Removed

- Deprecated `version` field from all Docker Compose files
- `:Z` SELinux flag from socket mounts (incompatible with macOS socket files)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` (replaced by `project.yaml` and `local.yaml`)
- `docker-compose.sidecar.yaml` (merged into main `docker-compose.yml`)

### Fixed

- Test failures from lingering containers between test phases (added `PYTEST_SKIP_CONTAINER_CHECK`)
- Improved error messages for devcontainer startup failures
- SSH commit signing: Changed `user.signingkey` from file path to email identifier to support SSH agent forwarding.
  Git now uses the SSH agent for signing by looking up the email in allowed-signers and matching with the agent key.
- Fixed `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` path to use container path instead of host path after copying git configuration.
- Automatically add git user email to allowed-signers file during setup to ensure commits can be signed and verified.
- macOS Podman socket mounting errors caused by SELinux `:Z` flag on socket files
- Test failures from lingering containers now detected and reported before test run
- Socket detection during tests now matches runtime behavior (Podman-first)

### Security

## [0.1] - 2025-12-10

### Core Image

- Development container image based on Python 3.12 (Debian Trixie)
- Multi-architecture support (AMD64, ARM64)
- System tools: git, gh (GitHub CLI), curl, openssh-client, ca-certificates
- Python tools: uv, pre-commit, ruff
- Pre-configured development environment with minimal overhead

### Devcontainer Integration

- VS Code devcontainer template with init-workspace script setting organization and project name
- Docker Compose orchestration for flexible container management
- Support for mounting additional folders via docker-compose.override.yml
- Container lifecycle scripts `post-create.sh`, `initialize.sh` and `post-attach.sh` for seamless development setup
- Automatic Git configuration synchronization from host machine
- SSH commit signing support with signature verification
- Focused `.devcontainer/README.md` with version tracking, lifecycle documentation, and workspace configuration guide
- User-specific `workspace.code-workspace.example` for multi-root VS Code workspaces (actual file is gitignored)

### Testing Infrastructure

- Three-tiered test suite: image tests, integration tests, and registry tests
- Automated testing with pytest and testinfra
- Registry tests with optimized minimal Containerfile (10-20s builds)
- Session-scoped fixtures for efficient test execution
- Comprehensive validation of push/pull/clean workflows
- Tests verify devcontainer README version in pushed images
- Helper function tests for README update utilities

### Automation and Tooling

- Justfile with build, test, push, pull, and clean recipes
- Automated version management and git tagging
- Automatic README.md updates with version and image size during releases
- Push script with multi-architecture builds and registry validation
- Setup script for development environment initialization
- `update_readme.py` helper script for patching README metadata (version, size, development reset)
- Automatic devcontainer README version updates during releases

### Documentation and Templates

- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request, task)
- Pull request template with comprehensive checklist
- Complete project documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTE.md, TESTING.md)
- Detailed testing strategy and workflow documentation
- Push script updates README files in both project and assets
