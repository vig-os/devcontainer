# TDD

When implementing features or fixes that have testable behavior:

1. Write the failing test first. Run it. Confirm it fails.
2. Write minimal code to make the test pass. Run it. Confirm it passes.
3. Refactor. Run tests. Confirm no regressions.

Do not write implementation code before its test. If you already wrote code, delete it and start with the test.

Skip TDD only for non-testable changes (config, templates, docs). Note why when skipping.
