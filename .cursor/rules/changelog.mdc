# Changelog Update Rules

When making code changes, follow these rules for updating [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## When to update

- **Always update** for `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `build`, `revert`, `style`, `test`, `docs` changes that affect user-visible behavior, public API, or developer workflow.
- **Skip** for `chore` commits that are purely internal (dependency bumps, CI-only config tweaks, formatting) unless they have user-visible impact.
- When in doubt, add an entry — it's easier to remove during review than to add later.

## Where to update

- Edit **only** the `## Unreleased` section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Place the entry under the correct category heading. Create the heading if it doesn't exist yet.
- **Never** modify entries below `## Unreleased` (those are released versions).
- **Never** change the release date or version number of any section.

## Category headings (in order)

Use these [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) categories:

```
### Added       — new features, capabilities, tools
### Changed     — changes to existing functionality
### Deprecated  — features that will be removed
### Removed     — features that were removed
### Fixed       — bug fixes
### Security    — vulnerability fixes or security improvements
```

## Entry format

Follow the existing style in the file:

```markdown
- **Bold short title** ([#<issue>](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/<issue>))
  - Detail bullet explaining what was done
  - Additional detail bullet if needed
```

Rules:
- Start with `- **Bold title**` followed by the issue link in parentheses.
- Use sub-bullets (indented with two spaces) for implementation details.
- Reference the GitHub issue number from the `Refs:` line in the commit.
- If multiple issues are related, list them: `([#12](url), [#13](url))`.
- Keep descriptions concise and user-focused (what changed, not how).

## Example

```markdown
## Unreleased

### Added

- **SSH agent forwarding** ([#42](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/42))
  - Forward host SSH agent into devcontainer for seamless git authentication
  - Integration tests for SSH socket availability

### Fixed

- **Broken venv prompt after rename** ([#43](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/43))
  - Post-create script now correctly updates the activate script prompt
```

## Relationship to issue templates

If the issue has a **Changelog Category** field (e.g. "Added", "Fixed"), use that as the category. If the field says "No changelog needed", skip the changelog update.
