# Contributing to vigOS Development Environment

This guide explains how to develop, build, test, and release the vigOS development container image.

## Requirements

| Component            | Version | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| **podman** | >=4.0 | Container runtime, compose, and image building |
| **just** | >=1.40.0 | Command runner for task automation |
| **git** | >=2.34 | Version control and pre-commit hooks |
| **ssh** | latest | GitHub authentication and commit signing |
| **gh** | latest | GitHub CLI for repository and PR/issue management |
| **npm** | latest | Node.js package manager (for DevContainer CLI) |
| **uv** | >=0.8 | Python package and project manager |
| **bats** | 1.13.0 | Bash Automated Testing System for shell script tests |
| **devcontainer** | 0.81.1 | DevContainer CLI for testing devcontainer functionality |
| **parallel** | latest | Parallelizes BATS test execution for faster test runs |

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y podman git openssh-client nodejs npm parallel
# just
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to /usr/local/bin

# gh
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gh

```

**macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install podman just git openssh gh node parallel
```

- For other Linux distributions, use your package manager (e.g., `dnf`, `yum`, `zypper`, `apk`) to install these dependencies.
- Run `./scripts/init.sh` to check dependencies and get OS-specific installation commands.
- Ensure Docker is installed if you plan to use it instead of Podman.

## Setup

Clone this repository and prepare it for container development:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vig-os/devcontainer.git
cd devcontainer
just init           # Install dependencies and setup development environment
```

## Development Workflow

When contributing to this project, follow this workflow:

1. **Create an issue** to report a bug or request a feature
   - Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues) to document the problem or feature request
   - This helps track work and provides context for reviewers

2. **Create a branch from `dev` branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Work on the issue or feature**
   - Make your changes
   - Commit often and descriptively
   - Add tests
   - Build and test locally: `just build && just test`
   - Ensure your code follows the project's style and conventions

4. **Update documentation if necessary**
   - Update templates in `docs/templates/` (not the generated files directly)
   - Run `just docs` to regenerate documentation
   - Update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) with your changes in the `[Unreleased]` section
     - Add entries under appropriate categories (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
     - Use clear, concise descriptions
     - Reference related [issues](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pulls) when applicable
   - Keep documentation in sync with code changes

5. **Verify tests pass**

   ```bash
   # Run all test suites (image, integration, utils, version-check, install script)
   just test

   # Or run individual test suites
   just test-image
   just test-integration
   just test-utils
   just test-version-check
   just test-sidecar
   ```

6. **Create a pull request**
   - Create a [pull request](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pulls) targeting the `dev` branch
   - Link the PR to the related [issue(s)](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues)
   - Provide a clear description of your changes

7. **Accepted contributions will be merged into `dev` branch**
   - Maintainers will review your PR
   - Address any feedback or requested changes
   - Once approved, your changes will be merged into `dev`

```

## Release Workflow

Releases are managed through automated GitHub Actions workflows. For the full
reference, see [docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md](docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md).

### Quick Reference

1. **Ensure all features are merged to `dev`** and tests are passing

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   just test
   ```

2. **Prepare the release** (creates release branch, prepares CHANGELOG, opens draft PR)

   ```bash
   just prepare-release X.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Review and test the release**
   - Monitor CI on the draft PR
   - Fix any issues via bugfix PRs to `release/X.Y.Z`
   - Mark PR as ready for review and get approval

4. **Finalize and publish** (validates, finalizes CHANGELOG, builds, tests, signs, and publishes)

   ```bash
   just finalize-release X.Y.Z
   ```

   The workflow will:
   - Validate CI status and PR approval
   - Set the release date in CHANGELOG
   - Build and test multi-arch images (amd64, arm64)
   - Scan for vulnerabilities with Trivy
   - Push to GHCR with `:latest` and `:X.Y.Z` tags
   - Sign images with Sigstore cosign
   - Generate SBOM and attest provenance
   - Automatically roll back on failure

5. **Merge the release PR into `main`**
   - The post-release workflow automatically syncs `dev` with `main` and resets the CHANGELOG Unreleased section

## Version Tagging

vigOS Development Environment uses **Semantic Versioning** ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) to manage both GHCR tags and git tags:

- **Development versions** (`dev`):
  - Only local, without time stamp or git reference
  - Meant for development and testing only
  - Use `just build` and `just test` to build and test

- **Stable versions** (e.g., `1.2.0`, `2.0.0`):
  - Follow Semantic Versioning format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.2.3`, `2.0.0`)
  - Pushes to GHCR with both `:latest` and `:version` tags
  - Creates git tag `{version}` (e.g., `1.2.0`)
  - Use `just push X.Y.Z` where X.Y.Z is the semantic version

This ensures that `:latest` always points to the latest stable release, and git tags provide traceability for all stable container versions.

## Multi-Architecture Support

vigOS Development Environment supports both **AMD64** (x86_64) and **ARM64** (Apple Silicon) architectures:

- **Local builds** (`just build` and `just test`): Build and test for your native platform (ARM64 on macOS, AMD64 on Linux)
- **Releases** (GitHub Actions on version tags): The publish workflow builds and pushes multi-arch manifests (amd64, arm64) to GHCR
- **Pull from registry** (`just pull`): Pull the correct architecture for your platform from GHCR

This allows development on any supported platform and consistent multi-arch images for releases.

## Testing

vigOS Development Environment relies on comprehensive tests to verify both container images and devcontainer functionality.
For detailed information about the testing strategy, test structure, and how to develop tests, see the [Testing Guide](TESTING.md).
