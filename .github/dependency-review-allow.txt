# Allowed GitHub Security Advisories (GHSAs) for dependency-review-action.
# Mirrors .trivyignore conventions: each GHSA entry requires an Expiration
# directive. Expired exceptions cause CI to fail, forcing periodic review.

# GHSA-wvrr-2x4r-394v: bats-file@0.2.0 malware (false positive)
# Risk Assessment: FALSE POSITIVE
# - Advisory flags npm registry bats-file@0.2.0 as malware
# - We install from official GitHub source (github:bats-core/bats-file#v0.4.0)
# - Upstream package.json has never updated its version field from 0.2.0
# - The lock file records 0.2.0 regardless of which git tag is used
# Mitigation: Source is verified GitHub repository, not npm registry
