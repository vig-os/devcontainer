# Dependency Review Exceptions
# Allowed GitHub Security Advisories (GHSAs) for dependency-review-action.
# Mirrors .trivyignore conventions: each GHSA entry requires an Expiration
# directive. Expired exceptions cause CI to fail, forcing periodic review.

# GHSA-wvrr-2x4r-394v: bats-file@0.2.0 malware (false positive)
# Risk Assessment: FALSE POSITIVE
# - Advisory flags npm registry bats-file@0.2.0 as malware
# - We install from official GitHub source (github:bats-core/bats-file#v0.4.0)
# - Upstream package.json has never updated its version field from 0.2.0
# - The lock file records 0.2.0 regardless of which git tag is used
# Mitigation: Source is verified GitHub repository, not npm registry
Expiration: 2026-06-01

# GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4: form-data@2.3.3 unsafe random function (indirect dependency)
# Risk Assessment: MEDIUM - Requires active MITM to exploit
# - Vulnerability (CVE-2025-7783) affects form-data <2.5.4
# - Transitive dependency: bats-assert → verbose → reconnect → request → form-data@2.3.3
# - verbose, reconnect, and request are unmaintained legacy packages
# - Risk: HTTP Parameter Pollution via predictable boundary values
# - Exploit requires attacker control of request field + observation of random values
# - Impact: Limited in test-only dependency context (CI/development environment)
# - Ongoing investigation of BATS alternatives or direct dependency override
# Mitigation: Transitive dependency through unmaintained packages; usage in CI only
