# docker-compose.local.yaml
#
# Personal/user-specific compose overrides.
#
# Use this file for configuration that is PERSONAL to you:
#   - Mounting your personal directories
#   - Local environment variables (API keys, tokens)
#   - Machine-specific settings
#
# This file is:
#   - Git IGNORED (your personal settings stay local)
#   - Preserved during devcontainer upgrades (init-workspace.sh --force)
#
# For team/project overrides, use docker-compose.project.yaml instead.
#
# Example:
#
#   services:
#     devcontainer:
#       volumes:
#         - ~/my-personal-scripts:/workspace/scripts:ro
#       environment:
#         - MY_API_KEY=secret123

# Optional: Tailscale SSH for direct mesh access (e.g. Cursor GUI workaround)
# Generate an auth key at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
# Use an ephemeral + reusable key so stale containers auto-expire.
#
#   services:
#     devcontainer:
#       environment:
#         - TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-XXXX
#         - TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME=myproject-devc-mybox  # optional override
