# docker-compose.local.yaml
#
# Personal/user-specific compose overrides.
#
# Use this file for configuration that is PERSONAL to you:
#   - Mounting your personal directories
#   - Local environment variables (API keys, tokens)
#   - Machine-specific settings
#
# This file is:
#   - Git IGNORED (your personal settings stay local)
#   - Preserved during devcontainer upgrades (init-workspace.sh --force)
#
# For team/project overrides, use docker-compose.project.yaml instead.
#
# Example:
#
#   services:
#     devcontainer:
#       volumes:
#         - ~/my-personal-scripts:/workspace/scripts:ro
#       environment:
#         - MY_API_KEY=secret123

services: {}
