# Trivy Vulnerability Ignore Policy
# This file documents known vulnerabilities that are either:
# 1. Not exploitable in container context
# 2. Fixed in the latest patches but may lag in Trivy DB
# 3. Have acceptable risk for devcontainer usage

# CVE-2026-0861: glibc integer overflow in memalign
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - Requires specific malloc patterns not triggered by normal Python/tool usage
# - No known public exploits targeting memalign in containerized environments
# - System library; cannot be removed without breaking core functionality
# - Patched upstream; awaiting propagation to stable Debian releases
# Mitigation: Image updated to latest Debian stable with available patches
Expiration: 2026-06-01
CVE-2026-0861

# CVE-2025-14831: GnuTLS DoS via certificate verification
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - Requires attacker control of certificate chain during connection
# - Devcontainer uses GnuTLS only for SSH/TLS connections to known hosts
# - Impact is denial of service only, not code execution
# - Will be patched in Debian stable updates
Expiration: 2026-05-15
CVE-2025-14831

# CVE-2025-59375: libexpat DoS via crafted file
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - Requires attacker to provide malicious XML files
# - Used indirectly by system tools; not directly exposed in devcontainer
# - No user-controlled XML parsing in primary workflows
Expiration: 2026-05-15
CVE-2025-59375

# CVE-2025-7709: SQLite integer overflow in FTS5
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - Requires specific FTS5 query patterns
# - SQLite in container used only for pre-commit and build caching
# - No direct user input to SQLite databases
# - Impact would be denial of service, not code execution
Expiration: 2026-05-15
CVE-2025-7709

# CVE-2023-50495: ncurses segmentation fault
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - Requires specific terminal control sequences
# - Terminal environment is controlled by container operator
# - No public exploits known
Expiration: 2026-05-15
CVE-2023-50495

# CVE-2025-68121: crypto/tls unexpected session resumption
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - CRITICAL severity in Go stdlib v1.25.5 embedded in gh (GitHub CLI) binary
# - Requires specific TLS 1.3 session resumption patterns
# - gh connects only to GitHub APIs; no user-facing TLS server in devcontainer
# - Impact would be session hijacking in TLS connections, unlikely in dev context
# - Source: gh CLI binary (Go stdlib v1.25.5, statically linked)
# - Fixed in Go 1.25.7, 1.24.13, 1.26.0-rc.3; awaiting upstream gh release
Expiration: 2026-05-15
CVE-2025-68121

# CVE-2025-61726: net/url memory exhaustion via query parameter parsing
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - HIGH severity in Go stdlib v1.25.5 embedded in gh binary
# - Requires attacker-controlled URLs with crafted query parameters
# - gh parses URLs from GitHub API responses and user input (issues, PRs)
# - Exploitation requires deliberate attack via malicious GitHub content
# - Low risk in devcontainer where gh is used with trusted GitHub accounts
# - Source: gh CLI binary (Go stdlib v1.25.5, statically linked)
# - Fixed in Go 1.25.6, 1.24.12; awaiting upstream gh release
Expiration: 2026-05-15
CVE-2025-61726

# CVE-2025-61728: archive/zip excessive CPU consumption
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - HIGH severity in Go stdlib v1.25.5 embedded in gh binary
# - Requires attacker to craft malicious ZIP archives with pathological indices
# - gh does not extract or process user-supplied zip archives in normal devcontainer usage
# - Would trigger only during release artifact handling with untrusted zips
# - Impact is denial of service (CPU spike), not code execution
# - Source: gh CLI binary (Go stdlib v1.25.5, statically linked)
# - Fixed in Go 1.25.7; awaiting upstream gh release
Expiration: 2026-05-15
CVE-2025-61728

# CVE-2025-61730: TLS 1.3 handshake message handling
# Risk Assessment: LOW
# - HIGH severity in Go stdlib v1.25.5 embedded in gh binary
# - Requires multiple TLS records sent in specific sequence during handshake
# - gh connects only to GitHub APIs; no user-facing TLS server in devcontainer
# - Attack surface limited to client-side TLS handshakes with untrusted servers
# - Low likelihood in dev context with trusted infrastructure
# - Source: gh CLI binary (Go stdlib v1.25.5, statically linked)
# - Fixed in Go 1.25.7; awaiting upstream gh release
Expiration: 2026-05-15
